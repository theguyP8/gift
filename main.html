        <p>Dear Douae,</p>
        <p>Consider this a simple gift from me to you. I'm sorry this is all I could give but I spent much time making it and researching to make it special.</p>
        <p>You have been a wonderful friend along my journey through life. I hadn't expressed it enough, but you are special to me.</p>
        <p>I know life separated our paths, but I'm grateful for the memories we've shared.</p>
        <p>You have been a great influence on me and you made me a better man.</p>
        <p>I'm bad at expressing my self well, so I hope this expresses it well, you are a great friend.</p>
